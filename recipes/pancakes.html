    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pancakes are so fucking good you won't even believe when you put a piece in your mouth.</p>
    <strong>YOU WON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT I SWEAR TO GOD</strong>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of butter, softened for greasing</li>
        <li>Toppings of choice, e.g. maple syrup, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid
            measuring cup. </li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
            second bowl. </li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk
            together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just
            combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.</li>
        <li>Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel.
            (You want just a bit of a sheen; donâ€™t overgrease the griddle.) Spoon
            batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on
            surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2
            minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with
            butter and toppings. </li>
        </ol>
